PREREQUISITES
-------------
PDQt was successfully compiled and executed on Qtopia environment, running
on Sharp Zaurus clamshell devices, and on any Qt3 platform.

In order to build PDQt, you'll need a working Qtopia or Qt3 SDK, if needed --
a working cross-compiler setup and the usual build tools (make, binutils etc).
You might take a look at the instructions how to build the Quasar Media Player
project (http://katastrophos.net/quasar). You will not need ccache, though.


MANUAL BUILD
------------

In the tools directory you will find scripts to set up a building environment.

For Qtopia use the following command to create a Makefile:

tmake pdqt-qtopia-zaurus.pro > Makefile

To compile with the MinGW toolchain please use:

qmake quasar-qt3-mingw.pro

You will probably have to delete "-lqt" from the resulting Makefile.

For native X11 compilation use this:

qmake quasar-qt3-release.pro

If the Makefile was created successfully, do a simple

make

to create the "pdqt" or "pdqt.exe" binary.

With ./tools/build-qt3-tgz.sh or ./tools/build-qtopia-ipkg.sh
you can create a needed package then.
