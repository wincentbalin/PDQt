PDQt is an effort to reproduce the idea of a synthesizer-on-an-audio-player
(as done by Martin Kaltenbrunner, GÃ¼nther Geiger et al., see for example
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kukNp4uwcKc , read
http://modin.yuri.at/publications/ipod_icmc2005.pdf and
http://gige.xdv.org/pda/ICMC2003.pdf ).

The sources for PDanywhere, the fixed-point version of Pure Data environment
came from http://gige.xdv.org/pda/ , the source for the user interface
on the notorious audio player came from http://ipodlinux.org/wiki/PdPod .

The goal is to develop a sound synthesizing environment based on Pure Data
which aims to run on (the clamshell models of) Sharp Zaurus, a Linux PDA
using Qt, hence the name PDQt.
